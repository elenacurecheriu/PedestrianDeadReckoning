# Pedestrian Dead Reckoning

Implementation of the PDR technique into an algorithm that retraces the path followed by the user of a chest-worn device, based on accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data, without relying on GPS data.

Done during my internship at StarTech Team.

## Features

- Step detector with adaptive thresholds and signal filtering
- Step length estimator
- Total distance calculator
- Path reconstruction

## Usage

The algorithm reads data from a CSV file, generated by the device, which includes the timestamp (in ms), accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data, split into 3 axis (X: left - right, Y: front - back, Z: up - down).

To run the step detector, first replace the filename in main to the desired input file then run:

```
python ./src/detect_steps.py
```

To get the total distance walked, replace the filename in main and run:

```
python ./src/estimate_step_length.py
```

To get a full retracing of the route with step indicators, replace the filename in main and run:

```
python ./src/retracing_route.py
```


## Examples

For the `test.csv` found in the `data` directory, we have the following outputs:
